                    <address>
                        A sum-based project is a great way to get started with
                        Java programming. The project is quite simple — the user
                        will input two numbers (which are treated as the
                        variables A and B), and the program will add them
                        together and present the sum of A + B. This can help you
                        learn to work with methods and integers. JavaTPoint
                        offers a great guide for a Sum A + B project, and
                        working through this type of project can help you become
                        familiar with Java processes.

                    <p class="second-title">Number Guessing Game</p>
                    <address>
                        This is a simple game that can help you get your feet
                        wet with Java. The game is relatively simple — the
                        computer generates a random number, and the user must
                        guess the number. The computer will then let the user
                        know that their guess is too high, too low, or correct.
                        This can be free-form, allowing an unlimited number of
                        guesses, or give the user a set number of guesses before
                        the game ends. Number guessing games involve some Java
                        programming basics like accepting inputs from the user,
                        creating classes, and using conditional statements.
                        GeeksforGeeks offers a number guessing game walkthrough
                        that can help you get started.

                    <address>
                        Creating a basic banking application is a great way to
                        practice your Java skills, as having some grasp of the
                        language will be needed to complete the project. This
                        project will introduce you to many basic Java concepts
                        like printing, variables, if/else statements, strings,
                        loops, and more. You’ll create an application that
                        allows a user to check a bank balance, deposit money,
                        withdraw money, and exit the interface. Check out this
                        ATM/simple banking app to help you work through this

                    <address>
                        Java is the basic programming language used for Android
                        applications, and it’s critical for anyone who wants to
                        get into app development. Writing code for a mobile
                        application requires unique tools and ways of thinking
                        about how an app should operate — developing around a
                        keyboard and mouse is very different from developing for
                        taps and swipes. Coding Android applications requires
                        using an integrated development environment (IDE) called
                        Android Studio. This environment will allow you to code
                        across Android app ecosystems. Creating a basic mobile
                        application is a great project for people with some Java
                        experience and knowledge. The Android developer
                        community provides a walkthrough on how to create your
                        first app — some basic Java knowledge will be needed to
                        get started.
